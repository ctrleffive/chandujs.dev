Currently working as a front-end developer (react) at <a href=\"https://www.hootboard.com/\">HootBoard</a>. Here, I want to share my experience of building a PC from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>I am using my Macbook Air for development since 2017. Building a PC was not really in my mind. At first, I thought I will just buy a new MacBook Pro and deal with it. But, there are a few things I always wanted to do. I wanted to move out of the Apple ecosystem and wanted to get a better understanding of how hardware and software work outside the Apple world.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a pro PC builder but I have assembled PCs before, and that was 7 years ago. A lot changed since then. This is my first time building a PC for myself!. So in a nutshell, I ordered the components from Amazon and assembled it by myself (without having the proper tools üòÅ to do it. I still couldn't change an M.2 slot because I don't have the tool to remove the screw holder from the motherboard. Plus, one screw set was missing in the package ü§¶)</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"usage\" href=\"#usage\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  Usage\n</h2>\n\n<p>My primary use of the computer is for software development. I make websites &amp; mobile applications mostly. The secondary purpose is image processing. I will be using different RAW image processing applications and image stacking softwares to process some of the photos. (Check out my Night Sky Album <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/kWnSeLuYdWdAGJpD8\">Are We Alone?</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I've looked into several websites like mdcomputers.in, primeabgb.com, vedantcomputers.com, and of course, amazon.in.<br>\nCPU seems cheaper in a local shop than the websites. So I bought it from there. The price of other components was different on different websites. But I ended up buying all the other parts from amazon after getting some reviews about the other websites. Mostly trust issues.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"configuration\" href=\"#configuration\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  Configuration\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here is the components breakdown.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>#</th>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Model</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>Intel i7 10th Generation (10700)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Motherboard</td>\n<td>Asus Prime Z490M-Plus LGA 1200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Memory</td>\n<td>G.Skill Ripjaws V 32GB DDR4 Dual Channel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Primary Storage</td>\n<td>Adata XPG SX8200 Pro 256GB NVME SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Secondary Storage</td>\n<td>Seagate Barracuda 2 TB Internal HDD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Power Supply</td>\n<td>Antec NeoEco 650M 80+ Bronze 650W Modular</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Cabinet</td>\n<td>Antec P82 Flow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Display</td>\n<td>LG 29\" Ultrawide - 29UM69</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Power Backup</td>\n<td>APC Back-UPS BE700Y-IND 700VA UPS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Keyboard</td>\n<td>Logitech K230 Compact Wireless Keyboard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Mouse</td>\n<td>HP Z3700 Wireless Mouse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>WiFi NIC</td>\n<td>TP-Link AC1200 Wireless WiFi PCIe Card</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"display\" href=\"#display\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  Display\n</h3>\n\n<p>In terms of display, my choice will be always a single ultrawide display. Maybe it's just me. But having multiple monitors in front of me is a mess for me. I usually take advantage of the multiple workspace feature in Operating Systems. So, a dual (or more) display arrangement is definitely not my interest.</p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"storage\" href=\"#storage\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  Storage\n</h3>\n\n<p>I try to keep everything very minimal. For me, a 256 GB SSD is enough for my usage. My Macbook Air is a 256GB variant. I am using it for all of my personal needs. I still have more than 50% of space left on it. So, getting a fancy 1TB or 500GB SSD is overkill for me. I bought a separate Hard Disk specifically for storage.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"operating-system\" href=\"#operating-system\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  Operating System\n</h2>\n\n<p>I've worked on all Windows versions from XP to Windows 10, a variety of Linux distros, and Mac OS. And I can say that I don't need Windows in my machine for my daily work. In fact, it's painful for me to do development on a windows machine.</p>\n\n<p>I choose Arch Linux as Operating System. Check out my setup <a href=\"https://chandujs.dev/blog/my-arch-linux-setup-19da\">HERE</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag__link\">\n  <a href=\"/ctrleffive\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__pic\">\n      <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1GMLvIIy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LKcmzzhL--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/61261/7d63301a-4388-4a48-937b-3e9a2ba3181d.jpg\" alt=\"ctrleffive image\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </div>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"/ctrleffive/my-arch-linux-setup-19da\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__content\">\n      <h2>‚öô My Arch Linux Setup</h2>\n      <h3>Chandu J S „Éª Nov  4 „Éª 1 min read</h3>\n      <div class=\"ltag__link__taglist\">\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#archlinux</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#kde</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#linux</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#setup</span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I always wanted to be a part of the open-source community. And I think being a Linux user could be a major part. I am the kind of guy who skips tutorials in software/games and tries to figure out the solution by myself (and ends up wasting more time üòÅ). Arch Linux fits really well for me in that case. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U-kgE9jN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xk9dzea8asay4mm770yr.jpeg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U-kgE9jN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xk9dzea8asay4mm770yr.jpeg\" alt=\"Arch Linux\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The DIY approach in Arch gives you control over every aspect of your operating system. And the user repository of Arch (AUR) has plenty of software packages. Whatever packages I searched so far is there. And even if the package is not available, you can simply download the source code and build it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>For some people, that sense of accomplishment after successfully installing the software really matters.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking about other accessories, I didn't go for any expensive models for the keyboard and mouse. I thought I will start with something simple and upgrade later. But I spend quite some money on the chair and table.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wrapping-up\" href=\"#wrapping-up\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  Wrapping Up\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j1dDRJdc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bbnugemcklu1zk5yxj2s.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j1dDRJdc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bbnugemcklu1zk5yxj2s.jpg\" alt=\"üòä\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The immense satisfaction and indescribable feeling of pleasure from building your first PC and fine-tuning your operating system is what drives me forward.</p>\n\n<p>Things I learned from my experience.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Have patience, it takes time.</li>\n<li>It's not as daunting as it sounds.</li>\n<li>Cable management matters.</li>\n<li>You are your own tech support.</li>\n<li>Do not buy components just because someone said it's cool!</li>\n<li>Do not turn on the Chassis Intrusion Detection option in BIOS if your chassis doesn't have that feature.</li>\n<li>If you want to reset the BIOS, shutdown and remove the battery from the motherboard and then short the BIOS reset pins.</li>\n<li>Always refer to the motherboard manual.</li>\n<li>Have a proper &amp; stable power connection for your PC.</li>\n<li>Have good tools.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have an active internet connection and a computer with you during the process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've created a Google Photos album with some of the photos of the process.
